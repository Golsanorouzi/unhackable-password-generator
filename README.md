# Code Refactor

This project was initially built with the wrong structure of both HTML and CSS elements.

This project aimed to refactor the structure of semantic HTML elements without changing any of the original displays on the website.

## What is learned through this project?
Through this project I learned:

- The importance of accessibility standards in order for the site to be optimized for search engines.

- The importance of semantic HTML elements.

- The process of creating and completing a new repository.
